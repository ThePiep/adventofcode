## Advent of Code (AoC)

This repository contains my progress on my solutions to the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.

### Obtaining input files

As per request of the author, the puzzle input files are not included. They can be obtained can be obtained by [signing in to AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2025/auth/login), obtaining the input for the specific day, and saving the input as either `input[day_number].txt` (for `2020`/`2021`) or `input.txt` in the appropriate folder. Solutions for the 2025 event also require `example.txt` which can be found within the puzzle description.

When your session token is provided in `2025/cookies.txt`, the puzzle input files for the 2025 event can be obtained with [Just](https://github.com/casey/just):

```
cd 2025; just get-input day1
```

### 2025: A fresh start with commitment

This year I am committing to completing the event from start to finish. No LLM will be used during the completion, the goal is to complete each puzzle on the day it is posted (if my schedule allows for it).
